# Discord prediction/gambling bot
Discord bot built using python. Get coins by playing different minigames or get lucky gambling.
This bot also has a prediction command simular to Twitch predictions except you have multiple options instead of only 2.
This is my first ever project so there are probably a ton of mistakes, I tried commenting my code as much as possible to make it easier to read.

## Do this before running the bot
There are a few lines you need to edit, I marked them with "###", they are all at the beginning of the file.

Once it's running use !help to see all available commands.
If you find any bugs or have any feature requests let me know!
